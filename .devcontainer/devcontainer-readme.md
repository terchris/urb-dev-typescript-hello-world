# DevContainer Toolbox

The toolbox contains the tools for working in our Azure environment. It includes configurations and tools for working with Azure infrastructure, data platforms, security operations, development and monitoring.

It gives everyone a common startingpoint. The base install sets up the tools everyone needs.
You can tailor the tolbox so that it fits your role by running scripts after the initial toolbox is set up.

The toolbox works on Mac and Windows and contains a base system and a set of extensions.

## All software you need is in a devcontainer

The base system is a development container that runs all sw so that you dont need to install any of it on your machine. You acuually dont need to know what a devcontainer is as this setup just works. But if you want to read up on devcontainer then this is a good startigpoint [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). If you are a visual learner you can look at this intro video [introduction to devcontainers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1RavPr_878&t=38s).

The beauty of using a devcontainer is that you will have the same tools and setup on all your machines (Win/Mac/Linux). And you can try out new tools without affecting your machine. If you install something that you dont like, you can just delete the container and rebuild it. Deleting the container will not affect your machine or the files you are working on.

Devcontainers are especially useful when you need to onboard new developers to your project. They dont need to know about your machine setup and tools. They can just open the project in the devcontainer and start working.

## Base system

| What | Purpose | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Dev container | OS that runs it all | [Debian 12 Bookworm](https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/) image made by Microsoft that includes python |
| [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) | Azure command line | For interacting with Azure |

| [Node.js 2x.x](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v20-release-announce) | dev and scripts | including Typescript |
| command line tools | various | git, curl, wget, zsh, apt-transport-https, gnupg2, software-properties-common |

The base sw is set up by the [Dockerfile.base](Dockerfile.base) in the `.devcontailer` folder.

## Base vscode Extensions

| Extension | Purpose | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| [Azure Account](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) | Authentication & Account Management | Unified login experience for Azure extensions |

The base extensions is set up by the [devcontainer.json](devcontainer.json) in the `.devcontailer` folder.

## Install and uninstall

The system works on Windows and Mac. Read the [setup-windows.md](./setup/setup-windows.md) and [setup-mac.md](./setup/setup-mac.md) for how to set it up.

### Post-creation setup (optional)

After the container is created the script [post-create.sh](post-create.sh) is run. By default it just verifies that the base tools are installed. But you can extend it to install additional tools. Eg like the install-powershell.sh script.

You can also manually tailor the container by editing the [devcontainer.local.json](devcontainer.local.json) file and the [Dockerfile.local](Dockerfile.local) file.
TODO: test the .local files in a project

## Extending the toolbox for your use

We have prepared some scripts that will install additional software and extensions that you might need.
These scripts are run inside the devcontainer after it is started. To open a container terminal in vscode select Terminal -> New Terminal.
Then change to the directory where the script is located and run it.
eg:

```bash
cd .devcontainer/additions
./install-powershell.sh
```
