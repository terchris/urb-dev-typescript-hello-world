# DevContainer Toolbox

A comprehensive development container setup that provides a consistent development environment across Windows, Mac, and Linux. This toolbox includes configurations and tools for working with Azure infrastructure, data platforms, security operations, development, and monitoring.

## About

The DevContainer Toolbox provides:

- A pre-configured development environment using Debian 12 Bookworm
- Essential base tools including Azure CLI, Python, Node.js, and common command-line utilities
- Core VS Code extensions for Azure development, PowerShell, Markdown, and YAML support
- Extensible architecture allowing easy addition of role-specific tools
- Consistent environment across all development machines

## Problem Solved

- Eliminates "it works on my machine" issues by providing a standardized development environment
- Simplifies onboarding of new developers with a ready-to-use development setup
- Allows safe experimentation with new tools without affecting your local machine
- Provides a modular approach to adding role-specific development tools
- Ensures consistent tooling across team members regardless of their operating system

## How to extend the devcontainer

Add project dependencies to the script [project-installs.sh](.devcontainer.extend/project-installs.sh) and the next developer will thank you.
See [readme-devcontainer-extend.md](.devcontainer.extend/readme-devcontainer-extend.md)

## Alternate IDEs

This howto uses vscode. But you can use other IDEs.
